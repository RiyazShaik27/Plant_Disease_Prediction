## Features üå±
**Image-Based Disease Recognition**: Upload an image of a plant to predict potential diseases.

**User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive web application built with Streamlit.

**Multi-Class Classification**: The model is trained to recognize a wide variety of diseases across multiple plant types.

**Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for high-accuracy predictions.

---

## Getting Started üöÄ
To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these simple steps.

---
## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. This project uses a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

- **Python 3.8+**
- `pip` (Python package installer)

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `your-username/your-repository-name` with the actual repository URL)*

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

    ```
    pip install -r requirement.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Streamlit application:**

    ```
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

The application will automatically open in your default web browser.


---

## File Structure üìÅ
1. **main.py**: The main Streamlit web application file. This is the entry point for the project.

2. **trained_plant_disease_model.keras**: The pre-trained deep learning model used for disease prediction.

3. **Train_plant_disease.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code and process for training the CNN model.

4. **Test_plant_disease.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook for testing and evaluating the performance of the trained model.

5. **requirement.txt**: A list of all necessary Python libraries and their versions.

6. **training_hist.json**: A JSON file containing the training history (loss and accuracy) of the model.

7. **home_page.jpeg**: The image used on the home page of the Streamlit application.

---

## Model Training and Evaluation üß†
The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset of plant images, with details of the training process and evaluation metrics documented in the Train_plant_disease.ipynb and Test_plant_disease.ipynb notebooks. The final model is saved as trained_plant_disease_model.keras.
